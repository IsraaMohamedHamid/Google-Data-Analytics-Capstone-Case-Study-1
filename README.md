## **Scenario (Background context on the case study:)**
You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

## **Characters and teams**
● Cyclistic: A bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each day.
● Lily Moreno: The director of marketing and your manager. Moreno is responsible for the development of campaigns and initiatives to promote the bike-share program. These may include email, social media, and other channels.
● Cyclistic marketing analytics team: A team of data analysts who are responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide Cyclistic marketing strategy. You joined this team six months ago and have been busy learning about Cyclistic’s mission and business goals — as well as how you, as a junior data analyst, can help Cyclistic achieve them.
● Cyclistic executive team: The notoriously detail-oriented executive team will decide whether to approve the recommended marketing program.

## **About the company**
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.
Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.
Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, Moreno believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a very good chance to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.
Moreno has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. Moreno and her team are interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.

Moreno has assigned you the first question to answer: How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

You will produce a report with the following deliverables:
1. A clear statement of the business task
2. A description of all data sources used
3. Documentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data
4. A summary of your analysis
5. Supporting visualizations and key findings

To address Moreno's question on how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently, I have prepared the following deliverables:

1. **Business Task:** 
The business task is to analyze and compare the usage patterns and behaviors of annual members and casual riders of Cyclistic bikes to identify any notable differences.

2. **Data Sources:** 
The data sources used for this analysis include historical ride data provided by Cyclistic, which contains information about the rides taken by both annual members and casual riders. The data includes details such as ride duration, start and end times, bike stations, and user types.

3. **Data Cleaning and Manipulation:** 
The data required cleaning and preparation to ensure its quality and usability. This involved handling missing values, correcting data types, and removing any irrelevant or erroneous entries. Additionally, data manipulation techniques were employed to aggregate and summarize the data as needed for the analysis.

4. **Analysis Summary:** 
The analysis focused on comparing various aspects of bike usage between annual members and casual riders. This included examining factors such as ride duration, popular bike stations, peak usage times, and trip patterns. Statistical analysis and visualizations were used to identify any significant differences and trends between the two user groups.

5. **Visualizations and Key Findings:** 
The report includes supporting visualizations such as bar charts, line plots, and heatmaps to illustrate the key findings. These findings may include differences in ride duration distributions, variations in popular bike stations, variations in peak usage times, and distinct trip patterns for annual members and casual riders.

6. **Recommendations:** 
Based on the analysis, the top three recommendations are:
   a) Increase the availability of bikes at popular stations during peak usage times to cater to the demand of both annual members and casual riders.
   b) Develop targeted marketing campaigns to encourage casual riders to become annual members by highlighting the benefits, such as cost savings and additional features.
   c) Provide incentives, such as discounted membership rates or rewards, to encourage annual members to refer and bring in new casual riders, expanding the user base.

These recommendations aim to optimize the user experience, improve customer retention, and attract new users to Cyclistic's bike-sharing service.
